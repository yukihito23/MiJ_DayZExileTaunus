// Night Vision Script Made by BroDouYouEvenBro/Turboswaggg/Tripod27 (I use too many different names) with the help of Killzone Kid (his blog is awesome) and PabstMirror from the ArmaDev subreddit

// Just put this file in the libraries > documents > arma 3/ arma 3 - other profiles > profile you saved the mission on > missions/MPMissions (put it in the folder of every version of your mission you find to be safe)

// Then either add the words    [] execVM "NVscript.sqf";    to your init.sqf file in that same mission that you put this file in or make an init.sqf file in that same mission that you put this file in (make a notepad.txt file then rename the file to init.sqf) and put the words    [] execVM "NVscript.sqf";    in it and save

// This script does seem to slow down if other scripts are being used, sometimes delaying the effects for a noticeable amount of time depending on how big the other scripts you added to your mission are

// If you make any improvments to this script try to tell me! I know there are things you can improve since I just started scripting 4 days before I finished this and if you manage to make a better version I wanna use it
